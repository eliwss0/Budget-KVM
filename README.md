# Budget-KVM

This is a simple arduino program made to control a slapped together KVM comprised of a USB switch and two HDMI ports connected to an arduino nano.

Uses tttttx2's [ddcvcp](https://github.com/tttttx2/ddcvcp) library for monitor DDC/CI control and thomasfredericks' [Bounce2](https://github.com/thomasfredericks/Bounce2) for debouncing.
